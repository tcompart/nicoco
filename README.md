# nicoco frontend module

## Local development

You just need to run ```npm install``` and all dependencies are installed. This also requires imagemagick to minimize the size of the images.


Currently this project support three different modes:

* ```npm run build```
* ```npm run serve```
* ```npm run clean```

The local serve mode requires an existing PHP installation. This part is currently work in progress
and will be migrated.
